# NeuRIS
We propose a new method, dubbed NeuRIS, for high quality reconstruction of indoor scenes. The key idea of NeuRIS is to integrate estimated normal vectors of indoor scenes as a prior in a neural rendering framework for reconstructing large texture-less shapes and, importantly, does so in an adaptive manner to also enable the reconstruction of irregular shapes with fine details.
